# objective-note
Open source job tracking application - helping you organize your search and notes without spreadsheets.

## Why Objective Note?

I've worked on a project similar to this but in a SaaS format. I realize that paywalling such a simple app is disingenuous, and so I've decided to create a free open source application that prioritizes usability rather than money. 

By making this an application local on your computer rather than a webapp, you will own your data and have all access to it. I hope in creating this I provide a better tool to organize the jobs you've applied to, and provide an easy place to write your notes for reading.
